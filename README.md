# 👋 How was your last PR?

Hey there, stranger👀

Every pull request has a story —
maybe it was your **first PR**,  
maybe it got **rejected**,  
maybe it got **merged in 30 seconds** 🚀  
or maybe… it kept you awake at 2 AM 😭

I’d love to hear yours 💙

## ✍️ How to share your story

1. Click **Add file → Create new file**
2. Name it: `your-username.md`
3. Write about your **last PR experience**
4. Open a **Pull Request**

That’s all ✨

## 🌍 Why this exists

Because behind every line of code  
there’s a **human learning, failing, and growing**.

Let’s celebrate that together.

⭐ If this made you smile, consider **starring the repo** so more devs can share their stories.
